# LearnChain

A blockchain implementation built from scratch using websockets.

# Details

This implementation uses two servers when run: 

1. A HTTP server allows users to add blocks and connect with peers
2. A WebSocket server is used behind the scenes to send block data between nodes

# Notes

The P2P features of this project are still a work in progress.
